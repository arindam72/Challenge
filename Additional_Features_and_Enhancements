Additonal Features / Enhancements / Improvements that can be done on Transfer service:

-- Include additional validation to ensure that the from and to account ids actually exist
-- Transfer amount cannot be zero, it means nothing to transfer 0 from one account to another
-- Ideal scenarios should include an additional attribute containing the date/time of transfer (makes easy to track)
-- It should also include a unique transaction reference (could be a hash of from + to + amount + timestamp)
-- Additionally it should also include other details such as IP address (from where the transaction was initiated)
